# Jacinto-AI-MMDetection Usage

Additional scripts are provided on top of mmdetection to ease the training and testing process. Several complexity optimized configurations are provided in the folder [configs](../configs). Scripts for training or evaluation with these configs are given in the [scripts](../scripts) folder. They can be executed by running the shell scripts provided. 


#### Training
- Select the appropriate config file in [train_detection_main.py](../scripts/train_detection_main.py). Start the training by running [run_detection_train.sh](../run_detection_train.sh) 


## Evaluation/Testing
- Select the appropriate config file in [test_detection_main.py](../scripts/test_detection_main.py). Start evaluation by running [run_detection_test.sh](../run_detection_test.sh).
